## 📝 Notes

- Sections toggle uses useState to show/hide dynamically.
- Custom styling includes borders, shadows, rounded corners, and spacing for a polished UI.
- Works best on mobile screens.
- For older React Native versions, the gap in skillsContainer may require additional margin adjustments on individual items.
